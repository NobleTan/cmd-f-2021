# Inspiration
Throughout history, women have made extraordinary contributions to their societies. Some are well known, some less so, but all have been trailblazers. Explore a small selection of these women and learn what the reality still is today for many women and girls worldwide.

As of 2021, a significant content gender gap on Wikipedia still exists, where fewer than one in five biographies is about women and even fewer article contributors self-identified as female.

That's how we came up with W-aple Story! A fun way to celebrate women in stem one story at a time. Because there are so many achievements that need to be showcased.

# What it does
W*-apleStory is an interactive timeline of Women* Footprints throughout history, where you're able to add a woman to your network who created an impact or meet some women* in the past.

# How we built it
NodeJS, 
React, 
MTLH Canvas, 
Maplestory API ,
